He is widely considered to have shaped New York City more than any other individual in the 20th century. Caro uncovers the story of how Moses accumulated his power -- fascinatingly, without ever being elected to any of his numerous offices -- and how he ruthlessly exercised it to turn his bold visions into reality.

This book, published in 1982, is the first volume of a planned five-volume biographical series on LBJ. In this volume, Caro immerses readers with his characteristic depth and detail on LBJ\'s impoverished youth in Texas Hill Country, the complicated relationship with his father, his politicking throughout his education and early career, and the formation of key political and financial relationships that propelled him through the rest of his political career. From this narrative, readers gain a strong sense of LBJ\'s desire for power and the extent to which he was willing to go for its attainment.","publisher":"Penguin Random House","link":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/24311/the-path-to-power-by-robert-a-caro/"},{"id":2,"genre":"Biography","title":"Alexander Hamilton","subtitle":"","author":"Ron Chernow","cover":"hamilton","note":"Alexander Hamilton was a Founding Father of the United States who contributed immensely to the structure of the nation\'s government and financial system.

Chernow elegantly exposes the inner qualities of the enigmatic Rockefeller through exploration of his controversial professional activities and personal reactions to growing negative public opinion towards him over his lifetime. Readers discover that Rockefeller was driven by a powerful religious faith, an obsession with efficiency and a ruthless desire for control, while also possessing an unflinching belief that his actions were right.","publisher":"Penguin Random House","link":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/26804/titan-by-ron-chernow/"},{"id":4,"genre":"Biography","title":"Washington","subtitle":"A Life","author":"Ron Chernow","cover":"washington","note":"George Washington was an American military leader and Founding Father of the United States who served as the country\'s first President from 1789 to 1797.

With this perspective, Chernow provides readers with a fascinating exploration of Washington\'s life and character, and elegantly illuminates the origins of his extraordinary legacy. The narrative focuses on the subject\'s vital role in the American Revolution, his leadership position among the founders of the United States and his shaping of the newly formed government and Presidential office as its first holder.","publisher":"Penguin Random House","link":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297691/washington-by-ron-chernow/"},{"id":5,"genre":"Biography","title":"Grant","subtitle":"","author":"Ron Chernow","cover":"grant","note":"Ulysses S.

Chernow presents the subject in a more positive light than most historical assessments, providing readers with a articulate account of Grant’s humble upbringing and early years, his rapid rise to military leadership, and then his transition to political leadership. The author explores Grant’s personal flaws with nuance and suggests that the controversy of presidency stemmed from his financial naivety and misdirected trust in dishonest individuals, rather than own self-interest or dishonesty.","publisher":"Penguin Random House","link":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311248/grant-by-ron-chernow/"},{"id":6,"genre":"General Nonfiction","title":"The Making of the Atomic Bomb","subtitle":"","author":"Richard Rhodes","cover":"tmotab","note":"Rhodes’ comprehensive account of the discovery of atomic energy and its hasty development into a new type of weapon with unparalleled destructive capacity during World War II deserves the attention of any reader interested in the topic of science, engineering and technology.

The descriptions of the industry’s early decades are particularly intriguing, with all-in gambles by bold wildcatters, chaotic booms and busts, and monopolistic practices of Standard Oil. Yergin then explores the geopolitical implications of the world’s dependence on oil as it evolves over the following decades from fuel for kerosene lamps to fuel for military forces, industry and personal mobility. In parallel, readers are presented with the erratic history of how control of the production of oil was lost by powerful Western nations and gained by Middle Eastern nations.","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","link":"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Prize/Daniel-Yergin/9781439110126"},{"id":8,"genre":"General Nonfiction","title":"The Right Stuff","subtitle":"","author":"Tom Wolfe","cover":"the-right-stuff","note":"In “The Right Stuff”, Wolfe provides an illuminating and highly entertaining account of the attitudes and experiences of the test pilots and early astronauts associated with Project Mercury, the United States’ first manned spaceflight program.

Those that excelled in this unique environment were said to have possessed “the right stuff”, and were selected for the riskiest of all flights at the time: flights on the rockets being developed to take humans to space.","publisher":"Macmillan","link":"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312427566/therightstuff"},{"id":9,"genre":"Memoir","title":"Shoe Dog","subtitle":"A Memoir by the Creator of Nike","author":"Phil Knight","cover":"shoe-dog","note":"Phil Knight is a founder of Nike and in his memoir, he shares a lucid account of the ups and the downs of the early years of the venture.
