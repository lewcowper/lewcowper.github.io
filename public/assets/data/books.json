    "cover": "the-power-broker",
    "note": "Robert Moses was an American public official who amassed immense political power in New York City and State over five decades from the 1920s and strove to turn his visions for the layout and appearance of the city and state into reality. Caro uncovers the story of how Moses accumulated his power -- fascinatingly, without ever being elected to any of his numerous offices -- and how he ruthlessly exercised it to shape the urban environments around him. Caro's painstaking research and intriguing findings are presented in an elegant and captivating style that may leave readers wishing that the book was even longer than what it is.",

    "note": "Alexander Hamilton is a Founding Father of the United States who contributed immensely to the structure of the nation's government and financial system. Chernow masterfully details Hamilton's short but remarkable life during the turbulent period surrounding the United States' independence. Through the depiction of Hamilton's ambitious actions and his complex relationships with other influential figures of the time -- including Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Monroe and Burr -- readers gain a real sense of the subject's passion and brilliance, as well as his arrogance and potential for recklessness.",

    "cover": "titan",
    "note": "John D. Rockefeller, Sr. was a prominent industrialist and philanthropist who founded Standard Oil in 1870 and controlled it until its forced dismantling in 1911 due to monopolistic business practices. Chernow elegantly exposes the inner qualities of the enigmatic Rockefeller through exploration of his controversial professional activities and personal reactions to growing negative public opinion towards him over his lifetime. Readers discover that Rockefeller was driven by a powerful religious faith, an obsession with efficiency and a ruthless desire for control, while also possessing an unflinching belief that his actions were right.",

    "note": "Rhodes’ comprehensive account of the discovery of atomic energy and its hasty development into a new type of weapon with unparalleled destructive capacity during World War II deserves the attention of any reader interested in the topic of science, engineering and technology. While the technical aspects of the Manhattan Project are the primary focus of the book, Rhodes provides thoughtful discussion about the social and political implications of the new class of weapons, and highlights the moral predicament that the remarkable team of scientists and engineers found themselves in when the first of the weapons were dropped on largely civilian populations in Japan at the end of the war.",

    "note": "Yergin provides a comprehensive and vivid history of the global oil industry from the mid-19th century through to the book’s publication in 1990. The descriptions of the industry’s early decades are particularly intriguing, with all-in gambles by bold wildcatters, chaotic booms and busts, and monopolistic practices of Standard Oil. Yergin then explores the geopolitical implications of the world’s dependence on oil as it evolves over the following decades from fuel for kerosene lamps to fuel for military forces, industry and personal mobility. In parallel, readers are presented with the erratic history of how control of the production of oil was lost by powerful Western nations and gained by Middle Eastern nations.",

Readers are pulled into the competitive world of experimental aircraft testing where a pilot’s credibility among peers is measured by the riskiness of their flights, their skill (and luck) in avoiding fatal failures and, perhaps above all, their coolness in the cockpit. Those that excelled in this unique environment were said to have possessed “the right stuff”, and were selected for the riskiest of all flights at the time: flights on the rockets being developed to take humans to space.",

Knight’s storytelling flows and he is candid about numerous decisions and mistakes that placed the company in precarious positions along the road to success. What was particularly inspiring – and entertaining – were the efforts of many of the passionate and unique employees of the company who possessed the will to win no matter the odds stacked against them. Progressing through the book, it becomes clear that the young company’s culture of striving for victory and never giving up is precisely what the company’s brand comes to embody.",

In addition, he shares his experiences working closely with the group’s pioneering founder, Kelly Johnson, who led development of high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft -- most notably the SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 -- which had profound political implications during the Cold War.",

This account caused controversy among other survivors of the event for from his opinions on what led to the death of eight climbers.
